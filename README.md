# Fruit Tea & etc. Shelf

This is our mini-quest to tidy up the kitchen counter area @[FoundersCoders](http://foundersandcoders.org/)

## Situation

### Clutter

The Work Space @[FoundersCoders](http://foundersandcoders.org) that [*we*](https://github.com/dwyl) have been calling *"work"* this year
has over 24+ people (*and soon to* ***expand***!), and *less than* ***1.5m<sup>2</sup>*** of **kitchen counter space**.

As a result of the *dire* lack of shelf-space everything gets left on the
counter surface.

On a ***good day*** the counter looks like this (*after its been "tidied"*):

> *Aside: Yes, the* ***lighting*** *is* ***poor*** *too, but that's another battle...*

### Teas

Boxes of teas & coffee are kept in the basket on top of the microwave. This was *ok* when we only had two types of tea but if each person has their preferance of tea it means accessing the one you want becomes a *game of* [***Jenga***](https://youtu.be/4w5kvC-zngY?t=4m33s)!

### Fruit

We do not have a designated place to put/store fruit so it often goes in a bowl/plate on the counter...


### Blender (*currently unusable because clutter causes clanging*)

You will notice from this photo we have a [**blender**](https://www.vitamix.com/Commercial/Products/Beverage-Blenders/The-Quiet-One) on the left side of the counter. This is *integral* to our (*other*) quest to be [*healthy*](https://github.com/nelsonic/health) and make/have [***green smoothies***](https://github.com/nelsonic/health/issues/3). Sadly,
given that the counter is always cluttered, everything starts to [*Shake, Rattle and Roll*](https://youtu.be/8B7xr_EjbzE) if we use it... We made the *investment* of buying the
[***quietest***](https://youtu.be/LazfnLAVKTA?t=3s) blender *available* to reduce
[*noise externalities*](http://www.econlife.com/noise-pollution-creates-negative-externalities/), but having clutter clanging on the counter totally defeats this objective!

So, we are going to ***solve this***!

## Proposed Solution

Shared the initial sketch with people in Gitter:

![shared initial sketch with people](http://i.imgur.com/vOL1bDN.png)

This SketchUp Sketch illustrates the idea but hides the detail.

I plan to use finger joints:

Produced the following cutting layout:

Sent the email to daniel@lasercutworks.co.uk

So it will be in his inbox when he arrives at work this morning.


> Update: my design was *way* too detailed and would thus take 8h< on the lasercutter...

I called lasercutworks and went through the design over the phone. Sadly,
given the number of cuts and etches,
Daniel said it would take the cutter more than 8 hours ... and at ***£1 per minute*** this shelf would cost me **£480** (*just in* ***Machine Time***! *the material cost of £36 is negligible by comparison*) so... back to the drawing ~~board~~ screen...?

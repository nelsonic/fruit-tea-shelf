# Fruit Tea & etc. Shelf

This is our mini-quest to tidy up the kitchen counter area @[FoundersCoders](http://foundersandcoders.org/)

## Situation

### Clutter

The Work Space @[FoundersCoders](http://foundersandcoders.org) that [*we*](https://github.com/dwyl) have been calling *"work"* this year
has over 24+ people (*and soon to* ***expand***!), and *less than* ***1.5m<sup>2</sup>*** of **kitchen counter space**.

As a result of the *dire* lack of shelf-space everything gets left on the
counter surface.

On a ***good day*** the counter looks like this (*after its been "tidied"*):

> *Aside: Yes, the* ***lighting*** *is* ***poor*** *too, but that's another battle...*
